# The notion of a Godel number is an unusual method of encoding information
# devised by Kurt Godel as a step in hproving his two famous incompleteness 
# theorems. For him it was a method for representing mathematical forumlas but
# it can be easily adapted to encoding words instread.

# It works like this. Each letter is assigned a number. Then the first letter
# of the word is 2 to the power of that number. The second letter is equal to
# 3 to the power of that number. And so on for the prime numbers. Then all 
# those numbers are multiplied together. The process starts again for the next
# word in the text.

# Using Godel numbers is, as a rule, tremendously inefficient as the numbers
# that result are quite large.

# For compatibility with other functions in the project the encoding is 
# returned as a string not as a list of numbers. The "sep" keyword allows the 
# user to specify what it used to separate the numbers of the godel encoding.
