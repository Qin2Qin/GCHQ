# A prefix code is any code in which words can be of various lengths but which
# does not need commas to show the breaks between them. There are many ways to
# accomplish this. This example uses the fibonacci numbers. To keep the encoded
# text as short as possible short codes are given to common letters. However it
# is still not especially compact.

# Of interest for classical cryptopgrahy is that a variable length encoding can
# disguised the actual length of the message.

# Lagged fibonacci numbers the sequence starts: 1,2,3,5,8,11

# There has to be a better way to do this, right?
# Go through the list for the first few fibonacci numbers from greatest to
# make a list of fibonacci numbers that add up to each code number (1,2,3...)
# The code is then the indexes of those fibonacci numbers, with leading zeroes
# removed, reversed, with an additional "1" at the end.
