# The turning grille was invented by Edouard Fleissner using an 8x8 grid.
# That used a grille with four 4x4 subgrids with spaces numbered 1 through 16. 
# In each subgrid four holes were punched out, different in every subgrid.

# Letters are written in the spaces of the grille. Then the grille is rotate by
# ninety degrees and the process continues. Then rotated and written in twice
# more.

# This version allows the grille to have any width that is a multiple of four.
# If N = 1 the grille is 4x4, if N = 2 the grille is 8x8, if N = 3 the grille
# is 12x12 and so on. Regardless of size one quarter of the spaces in each
# subgrid need to be punched out.
        
# If the text has too few characters three Xs are inserted and then after that
# are random letters. Of course this should be different if the plaintext might
# actually contain three Xs in a row.
