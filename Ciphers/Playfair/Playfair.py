# The Playfair cipher was designed to be a simple enough to apply rapidly in a
# battlefield setting while strong enough to resist significant cryptanalysis.

# It first creates a square of letters. The most common version uses a 5x5 
# square with the letter J replaced by I but this program offers four versions
# of the square. 

# To encrypt letters are taken two at a time and each is found in the square.
#  If they are in the same row each is replaced with the letter to their right
#  If they are in the same column each is replaced with the letter below
#  If they are in different row and different column they are replaced by the
#    letter found by keeping the same row and moving to the column other the
#    other letter.
