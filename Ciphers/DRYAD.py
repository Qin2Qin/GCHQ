# The DRYAD cipher was used by the US Army as a method for quickly encoding
# numeric information. A page of DRYAD consists of twenty six scrambled
# alphabets. For this implementation the Mersenne Twister is used to convert a
# number into such a page. Cryptographic weaknesses in the Mersenne Twister
# algorithm can likely be exploited. For truly secure DRYAD pages a stronger
# source of randomess is needed.

# There are several valid ways to use the DRYAD page for encryption. This 
# variation uses six letter chunks. Each chunk is a letter indicating the row
# followed by five encrypted letters. The row to use in each chunk is chosen
# randomly. To allow the encryption of long messages rows may be reused, though
# this significantly weakens the cipher.
