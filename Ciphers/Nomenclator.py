# A nomenclator is a cipher that operates on common pieces of language in order
# to defeat frequency analysis. The Great Cipher designed by Antoine Rossignol
# for the French in the 1600s mostly used syllables. It also has special
# symbols for distinctive words that showed up often like the names of various
# generals. In fact syllables could be written using any of several "code 
# groups". 
# This variant is designed for modern English and rather than syllables it 
# uses common letter groups. So a code group could indicate four letters or
# three or two or one. There are also "nulls" randomly inserted. These symbols
# don't translate to anything and are meannt to be ignored. There is also a
# supernull which means "ignore this character and the character that comes
# immediately after it".
# For every block of letters there are multiple code groups that can represent
# it in order to make frequency analysis even more difficult.

    # There are a preposterously huge number of ways to shuffle the one thousand
    # code groups that exist. The 32 bit LFSR only provides about four billion
    # possible shuffles. While it can be operated by hand it isn't entirely
    # reasonable to pick a new key for every message. Fortunately nomenclator
    # type ciphers require a lot of text in order to mount an attack against them
    # and historically only had the key changed very rarely.
