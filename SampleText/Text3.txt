As you have probably seen by the papers we all are in the midst of alarms We have had less than a weeks notice to get ready for mobilization for service in France and so it has been a rushing week Last Saturday afternoon we received word we were likely to be called out soon in two or three weeks but on Tuesday night I received word to have the nurses ready by Saturday It is now Friday evening and most of the nurses are ready but it is quite certain we wont be leaving for several days as the doctors uniforms for instance wont be ready till next Wednesday I am glad indeed for the extra time The nurses can take a very small steamer trunk and a suitcase As we apparently are to be sent abroad for the duration of the war it is rather a puzzle to know what to take Of course this order for foreign service is playing havoc with the personnel of the Unit so few expected to be called for duty abroad In fact no one expected a call of this sort at all I have been quite disgusted with the quitters who for one reason or another have begged to be excused I have had about ten drop out but I am finding substitutes who I think will be much more desirable than such weakkneed individuals But every substitution means a great deal of work and much telegraphing for each name has to be approved at Washington and after physical examinations are made here they also have again to be approved at Washington I have had a number sent back for more complete details I am to have a detachment of Kansas City nurses attached to my corps Ten and maybe more for there are to be sixty five and I had only fifty in my original order and some of these have been dropped or have had to fall out Two whose names I submitted I have had to drop by orders from Washington because they were born in Germany So there is much to do you see It is now Sunday and we are going down to hear Joffre speak if we can get into the Coliseum He and his staff are coming out to review the Unit at the Barnes hospital tomorrow I do hope that by this time next Sunday we shall be on our way for waiting around after one is ready is very trying particularly when people of all sorts are weeping farewells over you all the time Well anyway here is loads of love to you all We know it is the biggest opportunity of our lives People are being wonderful and are rallying around us splendidly We are offered more help than we can possibly use It has been pretty fatiguing but I am beginning to realize that I can take things more slowly now Naturally I wanted to be as nearly ready with all my force by Saturday as I possibly could be You can imagine the number of questions I have had to make up answers for that come to me every hour of the day and night not to mention all the details I have to impress upon many people those who go and those who stay But it is all wonderful beyond belief I just wish I had the words to express what I think about this opportunity Aside from what we think about the causes and principles involved and the tremendous satisfaction of having a chance to help work them out to be in the front ranks in this most dramatic event that ever was staged and to be in the first group of women ever called out for duty with the United States Army and in the first part of the army ever sent off on an expeditionary affair of this sort is all too much good fortune for any one person like me The responsibility of my big job of whipping into shape a band of heterogeneously trained nurses and of competing for loyalty and spirit with groups of nurses from the East and mostly all from one school seems almost an overwhelming job but naturally I am going to do my very best I have some splendid women to help me in the executive line and although we do not know each others ways at all we will do what we can As for the men we could not have a more splendid group to work with I shall have every possible help from them Personally I am feeling fine and oh so keyed up I cannot ever be worthy of all the honor and opportunities that have come to me not to mention all the happiness It seems as if my life has just overflowed with good things and that I can never live long enough to put back into the world all that has been given to me My little nurses are being so fine The present Senior class of thirty two would have been my first real class the first I have taken all through and they are weeping around that I am not going to be here to graduate them But tomorrow night after chapel I am to have a hearttoheart talk with them and I believe I can make them feel better

If only all you dear people at home could know how comfortable and happy we all are you would not worry the slightest bit about us Of course the danger is still here even if we dont notice it but everything is so serene it seems as though it couldnt possibly touch us The only time that one can even imagine any danger is at night when on the decks not a single particle of light can be seen except a dark purple glow at each companionway All the portholes are fastened shut and all the windows of the diningsaloon are shut and shaded as soon as it begins to get dark The main hall or whatever the place is called in the center of the boat where the main stairways are is also entirely dark so that when the doors to the deck are opened no light will shine out We are told that we are one of a group of boats going out together although out of sight of each other and that when we get nearer the other side we are to be convoyed by battleships We are getting wireless directions from cruisers now but are not sending out any messages We had lifeboat drill this morning with lifebelts on and each person knows to exactly what boat he or she is to go At times like those drills there is nothing but the greatest jolliness and cheerfulness In fact all the time there seems to be nothing but cheerfulness and eagerness to get to work I havent even heard of any apprehensiveness on the part of a single person As one of my nurses said in her slow drawly way There isnt any use worrying about the submarines If the Germans are going to kill us worrying isnt going to prevent it If the Germans do kill me Im going to come back and haunt the whole German army Everything has gone so very smoothly from the very beginning I really dont see how arrangements could have been improved upon Even the one trunk that got left behind reached the steamer in time and the two nurses who were to join us in New York turned up exactly as scheduled and all the missing documents from the War Department came before we left and as far as I could tell everybody had everything that she ought to have When the gangplank was pulled up and I realized that not one of my group could get lost for at least ten days and there were no more documents to expect by mail and no more telegrams giving more instructions it seemed as if a great load dropped off my shoulders It was a glorious day and the sail down the harbor was wonderful All kinds of boats tooted and blew their whistles at us and people on ferry boats waved and cheered us Soon after lunch the few necessary room adjustments were made and trunks were carried to the proper rooms Nurses had been assigned to rooms alphabetically but a few changes seemed to make everybody happy Some of the nurses are three in a room but quite a lot of them are only two in a room With the portholes screwed down there is no difference between the inside and the outside rooms The whole Pennsylvania Unit Base Hospital No 10 is with us going no one knows where any more than we do They seem very nice people and the Chief Nurse is the Miss Dunlop with whom I had been corresponding about work at the American Ambulance Miss Dunlop was in charge of the nursing at the Ambulance for some time and can give me lots of pointers about foreign service When we reached the St Paul that Friday evening about 6 going directly from the train to a ferry and from the ferry to the pier we found the other Unit on board A committee from the Red Cross was here giving out uniforms It took not much over an hour and a half before each nurse had received all her things and was free to go Each one was given caps and armbands a lovely soft cape lined with bright red flannel a soft dark blue felt hat with hat pins a heavy dark brown blanket a long heavy doublebreasted dark blue military coat and a dark blue serge dress The whole equipment is excellent and extremely good in quality and the fit was fine considering the way measurements had to be sent There was a box there addressed to every single nurse each one containing a dress and a coat The dresses are very good looking They have high standing collars with a little edging of white at the top and an edging of white at the cuffs Extra edging was found in an envelope attached to each dress There is a pleat that runs from each shoulder to the waist and a row of big black buttons follows those pleats There is also a row of buttons up the outside of each sleeve At the waist there is a belt and a clothcovered buckle The skirt has a pocket on each side and has a panel back The effect of the whole outfit is very shipshape though a little somber There is no distinguishing mark for Chief Nurses but Miss Noyes the Chairman of the Bureau of Nursing Service who came on from Washington to see us off said she was going to work out some sort of a method for distinguishing the Chiefs and would let us know later what it is to be A great many of the nurses sent back to their homes the heavy coats they had brought for the steamer I sent mine All the officers and the enlisted men are having regular drill every day I asked for some drill for the nurses too and we began yesterday greatly to the delight of every one the spectators as well as those participating We have regular settingup exercises as well as some military formations so that we can march in decency and order when we have to On shipboard standing on one foot and raising the other knee is apt to be accompanied with some merriment And some of our fat doctor officers have more or less difficulty lying down flat on their stomachs and getting up very fast But by the end of the voyage we all may be very proficient At any rate it is awfully good for the digestion Speaking of digestion we are having excellent food and as is always the way on a steamer altogether too much of it The diningsaloon holds us all at one sitting which is pleasant No 10 takes up all of one side and No 21 the other and the few civilian passengers sit in the middle I was assigned to a very good stateroom all by myself Then yesterday the purser moved me into a still larger and better room where I have a table and a droplight which is more luxury than I ever traveled with before People are all so good to us Even the stewards and the stewardesses most of whom are English seem to be only too glad to do what they can to make us all comfortable There have been a few seasick nurses which is hard to explain as the weather has been perfect and the ocean very smooth Today there is a slight roll but not enough to notice Every day there is target practice with the guns Empty barrels are thrown overboard and the gun crews shoot at them with the big guns that are on the forward and after decks Evening prayers are held every evening at 930 and yesterday we had church service and had all the enlisted men up Our Chaplain Dean Davis is a real man We got a choir together yesterday and last evening had some fancy singing which an overly critical person might call bellowing It is a mixed choir and it certainly can sing Now it is time I studied some French Friday afternoon May 25 Since I last wrote we have had some real weather and such a lot of sick people Doctors as well as nurses succumbed and great was the misery Today it is bright and sunny again and not so cold and everybody is recovering It was up along the Banks and opposite Labrador I guess where it was the worst It was cold and rainy and really very rough so much so that we had to have the racks on the tables I have not been sick a minute myself but there was one day when I was not much interested in eating Still I did not miss a single meal It is a heavenly day today We are already in or near the danger zone and extra precautions are being taken It all seems so queer Tonight we are not to undress and the few nurses who are on the deck below this one where most of them are are to sleep tonight in the doctorofficers rooms on the upper deck and the latter are to sleep in the sittingrooms There has been some special target practice when no passengers were allowed on deck and there was an elaborate boat drill this afternoon It is all strange business and still most incomprehensible to me I still feel as if I were dreaming and that in a few minutes I would wake up We are due to land Sunday afternoon at Liverpool it seems and are scheduled to go to London But after that all is shrouded in mystery My crowd of nurses are fine and have been behaving splendidly Comparing them to the Philadelphia bunch I feel that I have no reason to be ashamed of them or to fear for what they are going to do They have all shown a splendid spirit and seem to be full of enthusiasm and eagerness to show what Missouri can do when it tries I feel perfectly sure they are going to be a loyal hardworking group All the nice things that people sent to eat and read have been greatly appreciated I was just swamped with nice things but there have been lots of people to enjoy them with me I have slept and slept and read and read and shall be in fine shape when we land I was pretty tired when we started and was not sleeping as I should because of the multiplicity of details that were on my mind Except for the sick nurses the responsibility has let up a lot here on the boat but will of course begin again when we land My Squad Leaders have proved most efficient Miss Dunlop of No 10 and I have had some very nice talks I shall be sorry to lose her advice and assistance when we go our separate ways She is considerably older than I am and much more experienced For destinations there are rumors of Mesopotamia Saloniki Russia England and the North of France Take your choice Its a great game to be traveling thousands of miles and not know where you are going nor how long you are going to stay nor really what you are going to do when you get there We may even be in camp somewhere All the camp equipment is with us Well I like the game anyway Last night all my dear little nurses in St Louis were having their graduation exercises without me I hope they got the little speech I sent them poor as it was We were thinking of them One of the men at our table is keeping one of his watches at St Louis time so at every meal we discuss what is going on in St Louis When this letter reaches you you will know that everything is well with us You will know that before then come to think of it For it will take a long time for letters to get back to the U S A It is going to be ages before we shall receive letters from you worse luck I have enjoyed Elsies ginger and her book ever so much and Mothers wonderful Dean box is going to continue to be a delight for a long time I am going to try to take the box along for eats and to keep it for that I am not sure yet just how much luggage I can manage and I seem to have accumulated a good deal more than I started with The Ever Warm Safety Suit is awfully nice to have I trust I shall not have to use it but it is nice to have around anyway There are several of them on the boat This letter can be kept just for the family I am writing others to St Louis I do hope Philip will be coming along over soon and that it wont take long to find out where he is Dont you worry about me one least little bit I am having the time of my life and wouldnt have missed it for anything in the world Goodby for now I hope all your summer plans will work out smoothly and happily for you all
