# This attack on the autokey cipher is surprisngly simple. Since we have no way
# of determining the length of the key we will have to test many different
# key lengths. By default we check every key length from 2 to 30.

# To find the best key we first assume it is the letter A repeated many times
# which represents no key at all. Then we change the first letter of the key
# and test if it looks better. After going through all 26 posibilities for the
# first letter we do the same for the second. Then the third and so on.

Example of an Attack on the Autokey Cipher

Because there is no cyclic pattern to the key for us to exploit we have no way
to determine what the length of the key is we will have to try many possible
key lengths. By default keys with a length up to 20 are tried.
