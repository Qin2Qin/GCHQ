The simple version of the Hill Cipher is very hard to break with access only to
the ciphertext. In order to attack it some piece of text from the plaintext,
known as a "crib", is needed. Here we will try to break the 3x3 version of the 
cipher using a few different cribs.
In order to make this work we have to try the crib in many positions and do a
relatively large amount of calculation. As a result we will try our attack on
just the first 600 characters. If that fails we can try with the next section.
The minimum crib length is 9 but that will only work if the crib perfectly
lines up with a block. To ensure that we can decrypt the crib must have a
length of 17. A crib that long is not easy to get.
Suppose that we known this text is about sugar cane and we know the author has
the particular oddity of calling mollases "saccharine juice" from other things
we have seen written. We will try the following likely phrases:
THEWESTINDIES
THEISLANDS
THEMOLASSES
THESUGARCANE
SACCHARINEJUICE
